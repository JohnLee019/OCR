Beneath the orange sky,

a stray cat wandered through empty streets,
chasing shadows and fallen leaves.

A forgotten bicycle leaned against a cracked wall,

WS WHEELS SPINNING I THE BREEZE.
Somewhere, a clock chimed five.

Dreams and dust danced together. waiting for something—or someone—to return.
